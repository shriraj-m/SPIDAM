# SPIDAM_project
 Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling Project.
 This project exists to be able to analyze the acoustic data of audio files of the MP3 and WAV file type. Through this application it can provide the user with the waveform, reverb, and resonance data of the selected audio file. For ease of use, do not try to use the program with a corrupted audio file (i.e, a TXT file that was converted to MP3), it will cause the program to error. 

 This project acts as the Final Exam for COP2080 at Florida Polytechnic University.
